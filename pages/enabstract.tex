Time-based errors seriously affect the accurate measurement of broadband sampling oscilloscopes，but it is extremely difficult to accurately estimate and compensate for time-base errors. For the time-base error of broadband sampling oscilloscope ( including time-base distortion and jitter-induced error) ，the orthogonal time-regression algorithm is used to estimate the time-base error of oscilloscope for the first time. Compared with the multi-phase and multi-frequency least squares method，only to uses a set of approximately orthogonal sinusoidal signals to effectively estimate the time base error of the broadband sampling oscilloscope，and realizes the time base compensation of the measured signals. A time base error of less than 0. 3 ps is obtained，which significantly improves the measurement accuracy of the broadband sampling oscilloscope.
